## Description
This repository contains the project implementation for a Master's Thesis titled **"UAS Design and Simulation for Semantic Mapping and Human Detection using Computer Vision"**.

The project focuses on the development of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) application designed for manual keyboard-controlled navigation, real-time Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) utilizing RTAB-Map (Real-Time Appearance-Based Mapping), and advanced computer vision-based human detection using YOLO. By leveraging custom CAD digital modeling, modern robotics frameworks, and artificial intelligence, this system establishes a scalable platform suitable for complex, large-scale missions such as surveillance, mapping, and search-and-rescue operations.

## Key Features and Project Status

*   **UAV Design & Export:** The structural geometry of the UAV was completely designed and assembled within **SolidWorks**. It was subsequently translated into physical model parameters using the **URDF Exporter** plugin to generate the exact URDF and STL assets required for the simulation environment.
*   **Manual Navigation (Current Implementation)**: Precise vehicle navigation is performed via manual keyboard control, allowing operators to maneuver through the environment dynamically.
**Multi-Sensor Fusion & Semantic SLAM:** Utilizes **RTAB-Map** for high-fidelity 3D Semantic Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Advanced sensor fusion is achieved within RTAB-Map by dynamically fusing incoming streams from a **depth camera**, **odometry data**, and **LiDAR data** to ensure robust localization and accurate real-time mapping in unmapped environments.
*   **AI-Powered Human Detection:** Integrates a robust **YOLO computer vision model** to accurately identify and track individuals in real time from the drone's sensory feed.
*   **High-Fidelity Simulation:** Built and tested inside a realistic physics simulation environment ensuring flight stability and reliable obstacle avoidance. The simulation leverages a highly accurate digital twin of **Baylands**, a real-world open-space environment located in California, USA, providing an authentic setting for testing outdoor flight behavior and sensor perception.

## Roadmap and Future Enhancements

*   **Yaw Axis Stabilization:** Debugging and refinement are underway to address current issues with the yaw rotation movement within the PX4 Autopilot stack integration to ensure fully predictable rotational control.
*   **3D Autonomous Navigation & Obstacle Avoidance:** Building upon the currently implemented 3D manual controls (including XY position and Z-axis altitude movement), development is planned to transition to full **3D autonomous navigation capabilities**. This includes integrating advanced obstacle avoidance algorithms to enhance the system's overall autonomy and enable the vehicle to safely chart trajectories and execute complex flight plans in three-dimensional space without continuous human intervention.
*   **Human Pose Estimation (HPE):** Upgrading the computer vision pipeline to move beyond basic bounding-box person detection to full Human Pose Estimation, allowing the system to analyze human gestures, orientations, and states during search-and-rescue operations.
*   **Swarm Robotics Integration:** Expanding the platform into a multi-UAV cooperative network. Future research will explore swarm robotics configurations designed to simultaneously map large, complex areas and dynamically share real-time localization and mapping information to collaboratively locate targets, drastically reducing the overall operational time required to complete a mission.

## Tech Stack and Ecosystem

The framework was developed, configured, and tested on an **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS** platform, utilizing industry-standard robotics tools to bridge the gap between simulation and core execution layers:

| **Programming Languages** | **C++** (Low-level performance/development) <br> **Python** (High-level script orchestration) |

## Experimental Results

Simulated testing within the Gazebo Harmonic environment demonstrates:

1. **High-Fidelity Model Transfer:** The custom SolidWorks model structural dimensions, inertia tensors, and mass properties were successfully translated into the simulation environment via the URDF export pipeline, resulting in physical flight behavior that closely mirrors real-world UAV dynamics.
2. **Robust Ecosystem Interoperability:** Reliable, low-latency communication was achieved across the core software stack, ensuring seamless real-time data exchange between ROS 2 Jazzy, the PX4 Autopilot Stack, and the QGroundControl interface.
3. **Accurate Real-Time 3D Mapping:** The multi-sensor fusion architecture within RTAB-Map successfully generated dense, dependable 3D point clouds and semantic spatial maps, visualized in real time via RViz without frame drops.
4. **Dependable Object Detection:** The integrated YOLO computer vision framework achieved highly reliable real-time human detection across the simulated test sequences.
5. **Photorealistic Simulation Environmental Setup:** Environmental illumination and lighting conditions were explicitly configured to closely replicate real-world outdoor operational scenarios, validating the computer vision pipeline under realistic exposure constraints.
6. **Responsive Flight Dynamics:** The vehicle demonstrated satisfactory flight stability under manual navigation inputs. The primary flight dynamics including takeoff, landing, roll, and pitch responded appropriately to control vectors, with the exception of the yaw rotation axis which remains a targeted area for optimization.

rm -rf build/

# Build again with local install prefix.
make px4_sitl gz_x500 CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$(pwd)/build/px4_sitl_default/install
```
**Note💡:** Once Gazebo opens with the spawned x500 drone, the simulation stack is fully initialized and working properly. Close the simulator by pressing Ctrl+C in your terminal and proceed to the following step.

### **3️⃣** Setup uORB to ROS 2 Message Translation via Micro-XRCE-DDS
```bash
cd ../../
git clone -b v2.4.3 https://github.com/eProsima/Micro-XRCE-DDS-Agent.git ./external/Micro-XRCE-DDS-Agent

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib/
cd ../../../
```

### **4️⃣** Setup PX4 messages
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PX4/px4_msgs.git ./external/px4_msgs
```

### **5️⃣** Setup PX4-ROS 2 bridge
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PX4/px4_ros_com.git ./external/px4_ros_com
```

### **6️⃣** Setup the simulator to use the custom drone x650 instead of the x500 
```bash
# 1. Copy the x650 content to the PX4-Autopilot models folder.
cp -r ./external/config/x650 external/PX4-Autopilot/Tools/simulation/gz/models/

# 2. Copy the custom airframe startup file to PX4 ROMFS.
cp ./external/config/4229_gz_x650 external/PX4-Autopilot/ROMFS/px4fmu_common/init.d-posix/airframes/

# 3. Grant executable permissions and verify.
chmod +x external/PX4-Autopilot/ROMFS/px4fmu_common/init.d-posix/airframes/4229_gz_x650
ls -l ./external/PX4-Autopilot/ROMFS/px4fmu_common/init.d-posix/airframes/4229_gz_x650

# 4. Copy directly into the active build rootfs (for immediate testing without full rebuild).
cp ./external/PX4-Autopilot/ROMFS/px4fmu_common/init.d-posix/airframes/4229_gz_x650 ./external/PX4-Autopilot/build/px4_sitl_default/rootfs/etc/init.d-posix/airframes/
chmod +x ./external/PX4-Autopilot/build/px4_sitl_default/rootfs/etc/init.d-posix/airframes/4229_gz_x650

# 5. Inform gazebo where to find the model and do a test run if everything works.
export GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH=$GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH:$(pwd)/external/PX4-Autopilot/Tools/simulation/gz/models

# 6. Test the settings
# Note: Gazebo should spawn the x650 drone in the environment baylands. 
PX4_SYS_AUTOSTART=4229 PX4_GZ_MODEL=x650 ./external/PX4-Autopilot/build/px4_sitl_default/bin/px4

# Note: To kill all processes issue: $ pkill -9 -f px4; pkill -9 -f gz
```
**Note💡:** Gazebo will open displaying the x650 drone inside the Baylands environment.
If your terminal outputs ERROR [vehicle_imu] 0 - gyro/accel timestamp error messages, you can safely ignore them for now. These errors appear because the ROS 2 bridge has not been started yet and will be addressed in the next step.

## Docker
**Note💡:** Will be coming soon.
